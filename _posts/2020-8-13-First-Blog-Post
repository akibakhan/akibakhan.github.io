What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
I think being a data scientist is about using programming and statistics fundamentals to gain insights from data. 
I really found Andrew Zola's Springboard Blog insightful post defining data sciences within the realms of description, 
prediction and causal inference to drive better business decisions.  

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
I believe the foundational knowledge in statistics and computer programming critical. 
Furthermore, as Justin Megahan mentioned in the "This is the difference between statistics and data science" blog post it is critical to ask 
insightful questions to get the baseline and understand what is the problem that is in need to be solved. 
So having a good foundation in soft skills - asking insightful questions, being a good storyteller, and presenter - are also critical knowledge areas for data scientist.  

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
The differences I see are in the data sizes that data scientists and statisticians work with. 
For data scientists, the data tends to be really large scale, large file data that allows for complex data modeling. 
While statisticians tend to focus on smaller sized data. 
I really enjoyed reading Data Science vs. Statisticians medium post and found the passage about statisticians focus on quantifying uncertainty very insightful. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I view myself more in the realm of statistics area as I have a more fundamental understanding of the theories and concepts in statistics. 
As I grow in my skills in computer programming and ability to perform more complex modeling work, my viewpoints may change. 
That is what I find most exciting - there is constant space for growth and learning in these areas.
